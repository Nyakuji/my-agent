Here's a file-by-file review of the code changes:

---

### `index.ts`

**Review:**

*   **Correctness:** The addition of `COMMIT_MESSAGE_PROMPT` in imports and the registration of `createMarkdownFileTool` and `generateCommitMessageTool` are correctly implemented.
*   **Clarity:** Imports are well-organized.
*   **Consistency:** The pattern for importing and registering new tools is consistent with existing code.
*   **Nit:** It's good practice to ensure all files end with a newline character, which this change addresses by removing `\ No newline at end of file`.

**Suggestions:**
None, this file looks good.

### `prompts.ts`

**Review:**

*   **Correctness:** The `COMMIT_MESSAGE_PROMPT` is well-defined and includes clear guidelines for generating a commit message (imperative mood, format, tone).
*   **Clarity:** The prompt is exceptionally clear and uses markdown effectively to structure its instructions, making it very easy to understand.
*   **Maintainability:** The prompt is self-contained and clearly states its purpose, which aids in future modifications or debugging.

**Suggestions:**
*   **Refinement:** While the prompt is excellent, ensure that the AI model ultimately used with this prompt is capable of adhering to all the specified constraints (e.g., title length, imperative mood). If the model consistently struggles with certain aspects, consider if the prompt needs fine-tuning or if pre/post-processing of the model's output is necessary.

### `tools.ts`

**Review:**

*   **Correctness:**
    *   `createMarkdownFile`: This function correctly uses `writeFile` to create a markdown file and returns a clear success indicator.
    *   `generateCommitMessageTool`: The tool definition and input schema are correct. However, the current `execute` function is a placeholder that returns a hardcoded dummy commit message. The inline comment correctly identifies this.
*   **Clarity:**
    *   The `markdownFile` schema and `MarkdownFile` type are clearly defined.
    *   Both `createMarkdownFile` and the `generateCommitMessageTool` are straightforward in their structure and intent.
*   **Maintainability:** The tools are well-encapsulated, making them easy to test and extend. The placeholder for `generateCommitMessageTool` clearly indicates where future AI integration should occur.
*   **Consistency:** The new tools follow the existing pattern for defining and exporting `tool` objects.

**Suggestions:**

*   **Critical - `generateCommitMessageTool` Implementation:** The primary next step here is to replace the dummy commit message in `generateCommitMessageTool` with an actual call to an AI model. When implementing this, ensure to leverage the `COMMIT_MESSAGE_PROMPT` defined in `prompts.ts` to guide the AI's output.
*   **Error Handling (Nit):** For `createMarkdownFile`, consider adding basic error handling around the `writeFile` operation. For example, a `try...catch` block could gracefully handle scenarios where the file cannot be written due to permissions or invalid paths, providing a more robust user experience. For a basic tool, the current implementation is acceptable, but it's something to keep in mind for production readiness.

**Overall Summary:**

The changes introduce valuable new functionalities: the ability to create markdown files and a framework for generating commit messages using an AI. The code is generally clear, well-structured, and consistent with existing patterns. The main area for follow-up is the full implementation of the `generateCommitMessageTool` to integrate a real AI model, using the provided `COMMIT_MESSAGE_PROMPT`.

Good work!
